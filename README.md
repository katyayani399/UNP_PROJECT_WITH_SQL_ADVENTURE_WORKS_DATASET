# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_SQL_ADVENTURE_WORKS_DATASET

This project utilizes the AdventureWorks dataset to create a clean, structured SQL database for analytical purposes.
It starts with data cleaning and normalization to ensure accuracy and consistency across all tables.
The dataset is then organized into a well-designed relational schema using SQL best practices.
SQL scripts are used to extract insights on sales trends, top-performing products, and customer behavior.
Analyses include revenue by region, seasonal trends, and purchasing patterns.
All steps—from raw data processing to final insights—are performed entirely in SQL.
The project highlights how SQL can transform operational data into meaningful business intelligence.
